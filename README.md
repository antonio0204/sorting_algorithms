# Sorting algorithms & Big O
## Big O
-----
Big O notation makes you grasp the very important concept of efficiency in your code. So when you do work with huge data sets, you will have a good sense of where major slowdowns are likely to cause bottlenecks, and where more attention should be paid to get the largest improvements. This is also called sensitivity analysis, and is an important part of solving problems and writing great software.s.
